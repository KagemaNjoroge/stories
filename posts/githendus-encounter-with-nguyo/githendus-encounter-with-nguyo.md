Today, I was busy tending to my goats, minding my own business, and celebrating the birth of a new _koori_ when my peace was rudely interrupted. Uncle Githendu called me at noon. I hesitated. Lately, I had been avoiding him like the plague—wherever he goes, chaos follows like a loyal dog. But curiosity got the best of me, and I dragged my reluctant self to his house.

Turns out, he wanted me to help him ferry water from the community tap. Now, in our village, there are three sources of water:

1. **River Irati**
2. **The community tap**
3. **The lotto tank** – a rainwater tank that belongs to Granny

The lotto tank was out of the question—Granny had once given Githendu money to buy his own tank, but instead of buying one, he spent an entire week at _Club Lollipop_, generously pouring rounds of _kafteni morgani_ for his ‘friends.’ When the money dried up, so did his fake friendships, and so he coiled his tail and crawled back home like an unfed dog. Since then, Granny swore that he would never touch her water.

Fetching water from _River Irati_ was another no-go. That place is downhill, and the return journey is a nightmare—especially when carrying a 20-liter jerrican. Besides, Githendu’s legendary shortcuts in life had already caught up with him—Mwalimu Kariuki had refused to lend him his donkeys, citing _"past inconveniences."_ (Githendu had borrowed them once, disappeared for two days, and returned them exhausted, starving, and traumatized.)

So, the only logical option was to fetch water from the community tap.

...

As we stood at the tap, cracking jokes while waiting for our jerricans to fill, _Nguyo_, the village’s only boda boda guy, showed up. He had been hired by the Chief to ferry water to the chief’s compound. And that’s when it happened.

A **damsel** passed by the road. Light-skinned, curvy, and probably in her mid-twenties. Everyone went silent. Even the tap seemed to slow down.

Nguyo was the first to speak.

> **Nguyo:** “Githendu, mùiritu ũcio niũmũĩ?” _(Do you know that girl?)_

> **Githendu:** “Nguona ta arĩ mùiritu ũrĩa ũrutaga wira kũuria gwa cibũ.” _(I think she is the chief's house girl.)_

> **Nguyo:** “Na kaĩ mũkiendaga arĩkũ Githendu?” _(Now tell me, Githendu, what type of girls are you looking for?)_

Silence.

I saw something I had never seen before—anger mixed with shame forming on Uncle Githendu’s face. The question had hit him deep. You see, being **unmarried** at his age is a **village scandal**, a ticking time bomb. And today, Nguyo had pulled the pin.

Without uttering a word, Githendu turned and walked home. Just like that. Defeated. Ego shattered. Dreams of romance crushed.

And I won’t lie to you—I was happy. Because **Githendu, if you are reading this… THE TIME IS NOW. MARRY!**
