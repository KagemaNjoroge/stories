## Table of Contents

Deep in our village stands the legendary Wathweri’s Five Star Hotel. If someone in the village tells you, “Ngora ho,” just know they are referring to this fine establishment. Founded on September 3rd, 1989, this hotel has survived decades by selling only chai (tea) and karara (a slice of mandazi). Nothing more, nothing less.

They once tried introducing ugali mafuriko (ugali and bone soup), but the villagers rejected it with finality. So, Wathweri’s went back to its usual script: chai and karara.

But what really makes Wathweri’s famous is not the tea, nor the mandazi—it is their motto, boldly displayed on a wooden board above the door:

"Uka urie na unyue, tucucu twaku nitukariha."

(Come eat and drink, your grandkids will settle the bill.)

A dangerous motto. One that Uncle Githendu took literally.

## Tools of the trade

On a calm Sunday afternoon, Uncle Githendu walked into Wathweri’s, hands deep in his pockets, checking for something that was not there—money.

But why worry? The hotel had already made it clear—payment was a problem for the future generations. Armed with this knowledge, Uncle Githendu settled at a corner, eyes glued to the Great Wall TV mounted on the wall, airing Inooro TV news. The atmosphere was peaceful—middle-aged men sipping their tea, humming to themselves like philosophers contemplating life. No women were present, except for the waitress.

When she approached, Uncle Githendu confidently placed his order.

“One cup of tea and six mandazis.”

Moments later, a steaming mug of tea landed before him, alongside a towering stack of golden mandazis. He requested a "kahoria", a sufuria used for cooling tea. With the skill of a seasoned chai expert, he poured the tea into the sufuria, swirled it gracefully, and began his feast.

One mandazi after another disappeared, but the tea mug was still three-quarters full. Naturally, he ordered six more mandazis.

After conquering that round, his eyes wandered across the room—just in time to see the waitress walk by, carrying a plate of chapatis.

His appetite, which had been on a slow simmer, boiled over.

“Another cup of tea and four chapatis!”

And so, another feast commenced.

Satisfied, Uncle Githendu wiped his hands on his trousers, stretched, and casually walked towards the door.

That’s when it happened.

From behind the counter, the waitress—Gasheni—called out:

"Ndunariha!" (You have not paid!)

Uncle Githendu froze. Agitated, he turned and dramatically pointed at the wooden sign above the door, where the hotel’s motto was written.

“Tucucu twakwa nitukariha.” (My grandkids will settle the bill!)

Gasheni was not amused. In fact, she took a step closer. Now, let’s be clear—Gasheni is not your average woman. She is from Nyeri. She can wrestle. And Uncle Githendu knew it.

"Ndurariha ciaku, urariha iria gukaguo ariire."

(You are not settling your bill; you’re settling your grandfather’s bill!)

The room fell silent.

Gasheni cracked her knuckles. Githendu’s stomach was full, but his pockets were empty. Were it not for Ngodoro, the village cobbler and barber, who stepped in at the right moment, Uncle Githendu would have learned what happens when you test a Nyeri woman’s patience.

**Moral of the story?**

_Do not test a Nyeri woman's patience_
